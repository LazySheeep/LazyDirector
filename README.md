# LazyDirector

LazyDirector is a Minecraft Paper plugin that introduce a special spectator mode to automatically observe player activities.

This plugin is designed to free spectators' hands from controlling themselves flying all around by automatically managing the spectating target and camera view. It can be used to spectate players in minigames, to live stream your server's holiday events, or just to record daily lives in your server.

NOTICE: Still in EARLY DEVELOPMENT.
